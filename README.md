## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

cutlass is a swift army knife for generating fcpxml files.

Making tables is just one swift army knife blade. It can also take a youtube video id and download it (using yt-dlp) and download the vtt subtiles, and then make an fcpxml with video already cut into nice logical segments based on the timecode of the vtt info.
