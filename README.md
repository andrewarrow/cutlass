## Wikipedia Table Example

![table](https://i.imgur.com/mcAUx49.png)

^ this is from [Andre_Agassi Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi#Career_statistics)

```
./cutlass -i "Andre_Agassi" -w tennis.fcpxml
```

And after running cutlass you get `tennis.fcpxml` which opened in fcp looks like:

The red lines are drawn using a Shape title card rectangle and then changing the x y and transition scale x y of each line. Very rough first draft, the line logic can be improved and made to look much more pretty.

You can also run:

```
./cutlass -i "List_of_earthquakes_in_the_United_States" -w earthquakes.fcpxml
```

And get a completely different wikipedia table in this format.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

cutlass is a swift army knife for generating fcpxml files.

Making tables is just one swift army knife blade. It can also take a youtube video id and download it (using yt-dlp) and download the vtt subtiles, and then make an fcpxml with video already cut into nice logical segments based on the timecode of the vtt info.

this is a work in progress. The idea is to have cutlass understand the fcpxml format perfectly (no small task) and be able to generate impressive videos very quickly. Or at least generate a really good starting point for a human to then open fcp and tweak.
