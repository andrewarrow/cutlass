never generate xml from hard coded string templates with %s placeholders, use structs

## REQUIRED: DTD Validation
ALWAYS test for DTD validation after changing any code that generates FCPXML. This is MANDATORY.

xmllint --dtdvalid FCPXMLv1_13.dtd output.fcpxml

This validation MUST pass without errors. If it fails, the XML structure is broken and must be fixed before the changes are complete.

this program is a swiff army knife for generating fcpxml files. There is a complex cli menu system for asking what specific army knife you want.

do not add complex logic to main.go that belongs in other packages.
have main.go call funcs in a package instead.

make sure your code compiles, but do not run any of the menu options yourself. You can run xmllint but do not run ./cutlass
